		This is something that is not possible online. Vendible products are interactive and have a place in any shop.</p>

	Over 73% of people said yes or maybe when asked the question, "Would an interactive art installation in a shop, make you more likely 
	to physically shop?"
</br></br>

	Modern society is used to living in a digital world. Online shopping is more convenient and easier for a lot of civilisation. Vendible products
	give the public an experience which is not possible online. This will change the nature of physically shopping and encourage society to go
	back to visiting the high street.
</br></br>

    This is what makes Vendible perfect for small stores with or without an online presence.
